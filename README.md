COVID-19 Ontario Visualization and Modelling.


This project comprises my efforts at visualizing COVID-19 data in Ontario and modelling various trends using recurrent nerual networks (RNNs). It also has an application for the the Savitsky-Golay filter, and the Kalman filter.

The Kalman filter - invented by Rudolph Kalman- is a kind of Bayesian filter that attempts to recover the true state of a system in the midst of noisy measurements. Its applications vary from control systems engineering, to data science, as well as financial markets.

Applying the Kalman filter to COVID data simply makes sense. After all, the goal is to estimate a time-varying state (e.g. daily COVID cases measured by RT-PCR).
